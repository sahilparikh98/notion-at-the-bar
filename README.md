# notion-at-the-bar
A **very** simple Electron app to keep Notion in the macOS menu bar. It's incredibly barebones and was built using this awesome [menubar](https://github.com/maxogden/menubar) library. Its simplicity also means that it doesn't really have any features, other than giving you a portal to Notion by clicking the Notion icon in the macOS menubar. You can snag the app [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NdFSv6KixwNIE3i4yhRHcnNe8teJ4vRo/view?usp=sharing). If you're looking for something with more features, check out [Niftyman](https://shadowfax.app/niftyman).
