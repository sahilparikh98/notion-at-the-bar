# Notion at the Bar
A **very** simple Electron app to keep Notion in the macOS menu bar. It's incredibly barebones and was built using this awesome [menubar](https://github.com/maxogden/menubar) library. Its simplicity also means that it doesn't really have any features, other than giving you a portal to Notion by clicking the Notion icon in the macOS menubar. You can snag the app [here](https://github.com/sahilparikh98/notion-at-the-bar/releases/download/1.0.0/Notion.at.the.Bar-darwin-x64-1.0.0.zip). If you're looking for something with more features, check out [Niftyman](https://shadowfax.app/niftyman).
